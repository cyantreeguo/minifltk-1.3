// I hope a simple and portable method of drawing color and monochrome
// images.  To keep this simple, only a single storage type is
// supported: 8 bit unsigned data, byte order RGB, and pixels are
// stored packed into rows with the origin at the top-left.  It is
// possible to alter the size of pixels with the "delta" argument, to
// add alpha or other information per pixel.  It is also possible to
// change the origin and direction of the image data by messing with
// the "delta" and "linedelta", making them negative, though this may
// defeat some of the shortcuts in translating the image for X.
